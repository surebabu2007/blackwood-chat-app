# Memory System - Simple Explanation

## üß† How Characters Remember (Like Real People)

Your chat system has a **complete memory system** that makes characters remember conversations like real people do.

---

## ‚úÖ What Characters Remember

### 1. **Previous Messages** (Last 15 Messages)
- Characters remember the last 15 things you discussed
- They can reference what you asked 5 minutes ago
- They build on previous topics naturally

**Example:**
```
You: "Where were you at 9 PM?"
James: "I was in the study with Victoria."

[Later in conversation...]

You: "What were you doing?"
James: "Like I told you, Detective, I was in the study. We've been over this."
```

### 2. **What They've Already Told You**
- Characters remember secrets they've revealed
- They don't repeat the same information
- They build on what they've shared

**Example:**
```
You: "Tell me about your gambling."
James: "I... I owe money. A lot of money. $50,000."

[Later...]

You: "Do you have gambling debts?"
James: "Detective, I already told you about the fifty thousand. Why are you asking again?"
```

### 3. **Trust Level** (Growing Relationship)
- Start: Defensive and closed off (Trust: 20/100)
- As you talk: They trust you more
- End: More open and vulnerable (Trust: 80/100)

**Example:**
```
Start of conversation (Trust: 20):
You: "Did you kill her?"
James: "What?! How dare you! I would never!"

After 10 minutes (Trust: 60):
You: "Did you kill her?"
James: "*voice breaking* No... but I wanted to sometimes. She was going to destroy me, Detective. I'm not proud of that thought, but... no, I didn't kill her."
```

### 4. **Emotional State** (Changes Over Time)
- Characters start defensive or neutral
- Become vulnerable, angry, or manipulative
- Remember their emotional journey

**Example:**
```
First question:
James: "*defensive* I don't know what you're talking about."

Fifth question:
James: "*getting frustrated* I already explained this!"

Tenth question:
James: "*breaking down* Fine! I'll tell you everything... *starts crying*"
```

### 5. **Your Investigation Progress**
- Characters know what evidence you've found
- They react to your investigation discoveries
- They adjust their story based on what you know

## üîÑ How Memory Works (Simple Terms)

### Like Talking to a Real Person:

**Without Memory (Bad):**
```
You: "What's your name?"
Character: "James Blackwood."

You: "What's your name?"
Character: "James Blackwood."

You: "What's your name?"
Character: "James Blackwood."
```
‚ùå Robotic, no memory, repeats like a bot

**With Memory (Good):**
```
You: "What's your name?"
James: "James Blackwood."

You: "What's your name?"
James: "I just told you - James Blackwood. Are you listening, Detective?"

You: "What's your name?"
James: "*frustrated* Detective Chen, we've been over this. My name is James Blackwood. Do I need to repeat everything?"
```
‚úÖ Real person behavior, remembers, gets frustrated

## üí° Real Examples

### Example 1: Building Trust

**Message 1** (Trust: 20/100, Defensive)
```
You: "Tell me about Victoria."
James: "She was my sister. That's all you need to know."
```

**Message 5** (Trust: 40/100, Cautious)
```
You: "How did you feel about her?"
James: "Look... she was difficult. We had our problems. But she was family."
```

**Message 10** (Trust: 70/100, Opening Up)
```
You: "Did you resent her?"
James: "*looks down* Yeah... I did. She always made me feel like a failure. Like I was never good enough. *voice cracks* But I loved her, Detective. Even when I hated her, I loved her."
```

### Example 2: Referencing Previous Topics

**First Time:**
```
You: "Do you gamble?"
James: "I... sometimes. Just cards with friends."
```

**Later:**
```
You: "How much do you owe?"
James: "You mean from the gambling I mentioned? *nervous* It's... it's fifty thousand. To some dangerous people."
```

**Even Later:**
```
You: "Who do you owe money to?"
James: "*frustrated* Detective, I already told you this! The fifty thousand to loan sharks. Weren't you taking notes?"
```

### Example 3: Emotional Progression

**Beginning** (Defensive):
```
James: "I didn't do anything wrong!"
```

**Middle** (Breaking Down):
```
James: "I... I made mistakes. Okay? I'm not perfect."
```

**End** (Vulnerable):
```
James: "*crying* I'm a terrible person, aren't I? A terrible father, a terrible brother... everything I touch turns to ash."
```

## üéØ Technical Details (How It Actually Works)

### 1. **Storage System**
- **Zustand** stores all conversations

### 2. **Memory Size**
- **Last 15 messages** sent to AI for context
- **Full conversation** stored in browser (up to 50 messages)
- **Automatic cleanup** prevents memory issues

### 3. **Context Sent to AI**
Every time you send a message, the AI receives:

- Character's personality and secrets
- Current trust level (0-100)
- Emotional state (defensive, vulnerable, etc.)
- What secrets have been revealed
- Investigation progress
```

### 4. **AI Instructions**
The AI is explicitly told:
```
"You are having an ONGOING conversation. 
Remember everything discussed so far.
Reference previous topics naturally.
Don't repeat secrets - build on them.
Get frustrated if asked same question."
```
