# Character Offline System - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 **Feature Successfully Implemented**

The Character Offline System has been fully implemented and is ready for testing! This feature makes character interactions much more natural and realistic by temporarily putting characters offline when users ask inappropriate questions or use abusive language.

- **Irrelevant Question Detection**: Identifies questions not related to the murder investigation
- **Severity Classification**: Low, Medium, High severity levels with appropriate responses
- **1947 Authentic Responses**: Period-appropriate language and expressions

### 2. **Character Status Management** (`lib/characterStatus.ts`)
- **Offline/Online Status Tracking**: Manages character availability in real-time
- **40-60 Second Cooldown**: Configurable offline duration based on severity
- **Automatic Return System**: Characters automatically come back online
- **Status History**: Tracks offline events and reasons

### 3. **Visual UI Indicators**
- **Character Cards**: Red offline indicators with countdown timers

- **Status Badges**: Online/Offline status with WiFi icons
- **Tooltips**: Explanations for offline reasons and return times

### 4. **Chat Integration** (`hooks/useChat.ts`)
- **Pre-Message Validation**: Checks for abuse before sending to AI
- **Offline Prevention**: Blocks messages to offline characters
- **Automatic Notifications**: System messages when characters go offline/online

### 5. **Enhanced Components**

## 🎭 **1947 Authenticity Features**

### Language & Expressions
- **Formal Address**: "Detective Chen", "Madam", "Sir"
- **Period Slang**: "swell", "keen", "gee whiz", "goodness gracious"
- **Proper Etiquette**: "I should say", "quite so", "indeed", "I beg your pardon"
- **Social Context**: Respect for authority, formal decorum, class awareness

### Character-Specific Responses
- **Thompson (Butler)**: Highly formal, shocked by any impropriety
- **James Blackwood**: Upper-class indignation, proper decorum
- **Elena Rodriguez**: Professional but firm boundaries
- **Marcus Reynolds**: Direct but respectful responses
- **Lily Chen**: Gentle but clear about appropriate behavior

## 🚀 **How It Works**

### User Experience Flow
1. **User sends inappropriate message** (abusive language or irrelevant question)
2. **System detects abuse** and determines severity
3. **Character responds** with 1947-appropriate disapproval
4. **Character goes offline** for 40-60 seconds
5. **Visual indicators update** (red status, countdown timer, disabled input)
6. **Character automatically returns** after cooldown period
7. **System notifies** character has returned with natural message

### Detection Examples
```typescript
// ❌ Triggers Offline (40-60 seconds)
"You're an idiot!" → "My word, Detective Chen, such language is quite unacceptable."
"What's the weather?" → "I should say, Detective Chen, that question is not relevant to our investigation."
"Tell me about computers" → "Quite so, Detective Chen, but I believe we should focus on Victoria's murder."

// ✅ Normal Response
"Where were you when Victoria was killed?" → Normal character response
"What was your relationship with Victoria?" → Normal character response
```

## 📊 **Offline Duration by Severity**

| Severity | Duration | Example Triggers |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| **Low** | 40 seconds | Mild inappropriate language |
| **Medium** | 45 seconds | Moderate abuse or irrelevant questions |
| **High** | 60 seconds | Severe profanity or threats |

## 🎨 **Visual Indicators**

### Character Cards
- **🟢 Online**: Green indicator with WiFi icon
- **🔴 Offline**: Red indicator with countdown timer
- **Tooltip**: Shows offline reason and return time

### Chat Input
- **Normal**: Amber styling, enabled
- **Offline**: Red border, disabled, offline message
- **Countdown**: "Character is offline (45s)"
