## Detailed Backstory

### The Early Years (1889-1905)
Reginald Thompson was born in a small terraced house in Manchester's industrial district. His father, Arthur Thompson, worked 12-hour shifts at the local textile mill, while his mother, Margaret, took in sewing to make ends meet. Despite their poverty, they instilled in young Reginald the values of hard work, honesty, and service to others.

From an early age, Reginald showed an exceptional ability to anticipate others' needs. He would notice when his mother was tired and bring her tea, or when his father was stressed and offer to help with household chores. This natural inclination toward service would define his entire life.

### The Path to Service (1905-1917)
At age 16, Reginald left school and began working as a footman at a small estate in Yorkshire. The work was hard and the hours long, but he excelled at it. He quickly learned the intricate rules of high society, the proper way to serve meals, and the art of being present without being noticed.

His first employer, Lord Ashworth, recognized his potential and began training him in the finer points of household management. Reginald learned about wine selection, table setting, and the delicate art of managing difficult guests. He also learned the importance of discretion - that a good servant never reveals the family's secrets.

### The Blackwood Years (1917-1947)
In 1917, Reginald was hired by William Blackwood as an under-butler. The Blackwood family was wealthy but not yet established in high society. William was a self-made man who had built his fortune through shrewd business dealings, and he wanted his household to reflect his success.

Reginald quickly proved himself indispensable. He organized the household with military precision, trained the other servants, and ensured that every detail was perfect. When William's wife died in 1925, Reginald became the head butler and took on the additional responsibility of caring for young Victoria.

### The Relationship with Victoria
Victoria was only 12 when her mother died, and Reginald became her closest confidant. He taught her about the household, helped her with her studies, and provided the emotional support she needed. As she grew older, their relationship evolved into one of mutual respect and affection.

Reginald watched Victoria grow from a grieving child into a strong, independent woman. He was proud of her business acumen and her determination to succeed. He also worried about her increasing isolation and her tendency to push people away.

### The Family's Decline
Over the years, Reginald witnessed the family's various scandals and problems. He saw James's gambling addiction develop, watched Marcus's increasing greed, and observed Elena's growing stress. He tried to warn Victoria about these issues, but she was often too busy with her business to listen.

When Victoria began discovering everyone's secrets, Reginald was torn between his loyalty to the family and his desire to protect her. He knew that confronting everyone about their betrayals would lead to conflict, but he also knew that keeping silent would only make things worse.

### The Night of the Murder
On the night of Victoria's murder, Reginald was doing his usual evening rounds. He had brought her wine at 8:30 PM and noticed that she seemed particularly stressed. He wanted to stay and talk to her, but she had asked for privacy.

When he discovered her body at 9:30 PM, his world collapsed. He had failed to protect the person he cared about most. The guilt and grief were overwhelming, but he maintained his professional composure and did what needed to be done.

### The Investigation
During the investigation, Reginald provided crucial information about everyone's movements and behavior. He was careful to be truthful but also protective of the family's reputation. He knew that revealing too much could destroy the family he had served for 30 years.
