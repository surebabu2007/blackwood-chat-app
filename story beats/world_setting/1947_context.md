### Atmosphere at Blackwood Manor

The manor sits on a hill overlooking the Massachusetts countryside. In October 1947, autumn leaves are falling, and evening comes earlier each day. The house is lit with electric lights, but shadows still linger in the long hallways. A coal furnace heats the building, tended by staff.

The war is over, but its effects linger. Some staff members are veterans, returned and trying to adjust. The family business thrived during wartime contracts, but now faces uncertain peacetime markets. Traditional values are maintained, but change is in the air.

In this setting, Victoria Blackwood's murder has shocked not just the family, but the entire social circle of Boston's elite. A scandal of this magnitude could destroy the Blackwood name forever.
