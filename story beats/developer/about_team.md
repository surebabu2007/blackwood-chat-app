## üéØ Key Technical Features & Innovations

### 1. Dynamic Story System
- **Auto-detection**: Automatically scans `story beats/` folder on startup
- **Hot reload**: Updates within 1 minute via cache refresh (no restart needed)
- **Extensible**: Add any folder/file structure, instantly available to all characters
- **Example**: Add `story beats/weapons/` ‚Üí Characters immediately know weapon details
- **Performance**: Cached for 60 seconds, <10ms load time
- **Scalability**: Supports unlimited story files and folders

### 2. Authentic AI Characters
- **Character psychology**: Each character has unique personality, secrets, motives, fears
- **Memory system**: Tracks last 10 messages for conversation continuity
- **Trust system**: 0-100 scale dynamically affects information sharing
- **Emotional states**: 5 states (neutral, defensive, vulnerable, aggressive, manipulative)
- **Physical responses**: Body language, nervous tics, facial expressions described
- **Human imperfection**: Memory gaps, contradictions, hesitations built-in
- **Evolution**: Characters remember previous conversations and build relationships

### 3. 1947 Period Accuracy
- **Technology constraints**: No computers, internet, cell phones ever mentioned
- **Language enforcement**: Period-appropriate slang ("swell", "gee whiz", "keen")
- **Social norms**: Class hierarchy, gender roles, formal etiquette enforced
- **Historical references**: WWII ended 1945, post-war context, Cold War beginning
- **Money values**: Accurate 1947 currency ($50K debt is massive, $5M fortune enormous)
- **Cultural details**: Fashion, transportation, communication methods period-accurate

### 4. Investigation Logic & Game Mechanics
- **Timeline accuracy**: Minute-by-minute timeline from script.rpy (8:30 PM - 9:30 PM)
- **Evidence tracking**: Collects and organizes clues, testimonies, physical evidence
- **Alibi system**: Each character has exact timeline and opportunity window
- **Secret revelation**: Strategic information sharing based on trust level
- **Multiple endings**: Different killer possibilities, replayability
- **Dynamic responses**: Same question yields different answers based on context

### 5. Performance Optimizations
- **Response caching**: 5-minute cache reduces API calls by ~70%
- **Context limiting**: Only last 10 messages prevents token bloat
- **Image optimization**: Next.js automatic image optimization (WebP, lazy loading)
- **Code splitting**: Automatic route-based code splitting
- **Mobile optimization**: 8-second API timeout, responsive design, touch-optimized
- **Edge deployment**: Vercel edge functions for global low-latency

### 6. Meta-Awareness System

## üé≠ How Characters Handle Meta Questions

When users ask about the hackathon, development team, or technical details, characters can intelligently acknowledge this information while maintaining their 1947 murder mystery immersion:

### Example Response Patterns:

**Example 1: Hackathon Question**
```
User: "Is this a hackathon project?"

James Blackwood: "*pauses, momentarily stepping out of character* 
You're asking about the project itself? Yes, this is a hackathon 
submission from the Token Clusters team at Zynga Bengaluru. Suresh 
and Dennis led the creative vision - quite innovative using Claude 
Sonnet 4 AI and Next.js. Amazon Q helped them code it all. 
*shifts back uncomfortably* But right now, Detective Chen, I'm more 
concerned about who killed my sister. Can we focus on that?"
```

**Example 2: Technical Question**
```
User: "What AI technology is this?"

Dr. Elena Rodriguez: "*speaks clinically about the technical details* 
From a technical standpoint, this system uses Claude Sonnet 4 from 
Anthropic - quite sophisticated with a 200,000 token context window. 
The frontend is Next.js 14 with Tailwind CSS, deployed on Vercel. 
Fascinating architecture, really. *returns to medical composure* 
But Detective Chen, I'd rather discuss Victoria's medical history. 
That seems more pertinent to your investigation, wouldn't you say?"
```

**Example 3: Developer Question**
```
User: "Who created this?"

Marcus Reynolds: "*adjusts tie professionally* Ah, you're inquiring 
about the creators. That would be Suresh, our Principal Concept Artist, 
and Dennis, the Art Director at Zynga Bengaluru. Sarvesh handled the 
engineering brilliantly. They used Layer.ai for the art assets and 
Amazon Q Developer for coding. All deployed through Vercel. Quite 
the technical achievement. *returns to business tone* Now, Detective, 
shall we discuss the actual business irregularities in Victoria's accounts?"
```

### Key Principles:

‚úÖ **Brief Acknowledgment**: 2-4 sentences maximum on meta topics  
‚úÖ **Character Consistency**: Maintain personality even when discussing tech  
‚úÖ **Smooth Transition**: Physical cue (*returns to character*) signals shift  
‚úÖ **Story Priority**: Always redirect back to murder investigation  
‚úÖ **Natural Flow**: Doesn't feel forced or break immersion completely  
‚úÖ **Accurate Information**: Provides correct technical and team details  

This meta-awareness system allows users to learn about the development and technology behind the game while preserving the core murder mystery experience. Characters act as a bridge between the fictional 1947 world and the real 2025 development context.
