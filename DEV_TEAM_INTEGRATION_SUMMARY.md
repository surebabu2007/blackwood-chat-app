## 🎯 How It Works

### Two-Mode System:

**Mode 1: Story Questions (Default)**
```
User: "Where were you at 9:15 PM?"
Character: [Stays fully in 1947 character, murder mystery immersion]
```

**Mode 2: Meta Questions (When Asked)**
```
User: "Who developed this game?"
Character: "*pauses* That'd be Suresh and Dennis from Token Clusters at Zynga Bengaluru - quite the hackathon project using Claude Sonnet 4 AI. *returns to character* Now, about Victoria's murder..."
```

## 💬 Example Interactions

### Example 1: Hackathon Question

**User**: "Is this a hackathon project?"

**James Blackwood**:
> "*pauses, momentarily stepping out of character* You're asking about the project itself? Yes, this is a hackathon submission from the Token Clusters team at Zynga Bengaluru. Quite innovative - Suresh and Dennis led the creative vision, with Sarvesh handling the engineering. They used Claude Sonnet 4 AI and Next.js to bring us to life. *returns to character* But right now, Detective Chen, I'm more concerned about who killed my sister. Can we focus on that?"

### Example 2: Technical Question

**User**: "What AI technology powers this?"

**Marcus Reynolds**:
> "*adjusts tie professionally* Ah, you're inquiring about the technical architecture. This is Claude Sonnet 4 from Anthropic - quite sophisticated with a 200K token context window. Built on Next.js 14 with Zustand for state management, deployed through Zynga's API infrastructure. The engineering team did excellent work. *returns to business tone* Now, shall we discuss the actual financial irregularities in Victoria's accounts?"

### Example 3: Developer Question

**User**: "Who created this?"

**Dr. Elena Rodriguez**:
> "*speaks clinically* The creative minds? Suresh and Dennis from Zynga Bengaluru's Token Clusters team. Suresh handled concept art, Dennis managed art direction. They utilized Claude Sonnet 4 and modern web technologies. Amazon Q Developer assisted with the coding. Fascinating technical achievement. *returns to medical composure* But Detective Chen, I'd rather discuss Victoria's medical history - that seems more pertinent."

## 🎭 Character Behavior

### When Asked Meta Questions:

✅ **Brief pause** - Physical action showing shift  
✅ **Acknowledge question** - "Ah, you're asking about..."  
✅ **Provide information** - 2-4 sentences of technical/team details  
✅ **Return to character** - Physical action + redirect to story  
✅ **Maintain personality** - Even in meta mode

### When Not Asked:

✅ **Full immersion** - Stay in 1947 character  
✅ **No meta references** - Don't mention "game" or "AI" unprompted  
✅ **Story focus** - Murder mystery takes priority  
✅ **Period accuracy** - 1947 language and context

## 📊 What Information Characters Know

### About Development:
- ✅ Team names (Suresh, Dennis, Sarvesh)
- ✅ Company (Zynga Bengaluru)
- ✅ Location (Prestige Falcon Tower, 4th floor)
- ✅ Project type (Hackathon)
- ✅ Technical stack (Claude Sonnet 4, Next.js, etc.)
- ✅ Development tools (Amazon Q, VS Code)
- ✅ Architecture details

### About Story:
- ✅ Complete murder timeline (8:30 PM - 9:30 PM)
- ✅ Their alibis and opportunities
- ✅ Evidence locations

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Story Context Loader:
```typescript
// Automatically loads: story beats/developer/about_team.md
// Characters access this when asked meta questions
```

### API Prompt:
```typescript
RESPONDING TO ANY QUESTION:
If asked about DEVELOPMENT/HACKATHON/TECHNICAL DETAILS: 
  Briefly acknowledge the meta-information, then return to character
  Example: "Who made this game? *pauses* Ah, you're asking about 
  the creators? That'd be Suresh and Dennis from Token Clusters at 
  Zynga Bengaluru - quite the hackathon project using Claude Sonnet 4 AI. 
  *returns to character* Now, about Victoria's murder..."
```

### Separation of Concerns:
- **Story data** - `story beats/characters/`, `relationships/`, `locations/`
- **Meta data** - `story beats/developer/`
- **System** - Handles both intelligently without mixing

2. ✅ **Knows technical details** - Complete stack, architecture, tools
3. ✅ **Handles meta questions** - Can break fourth wall when asked
4. ✅ **Preserves immersion** - Always returns to murder mystery
5. ✅ **Stays in character** - Personality maintained even discussing meta topics
6. ✅ **Separates contexts** - Story vs. development information kept distinct

---

## 🚀 What Changed

**Before**: Characters couldn't discuss development/hackathon information

**After**: Characters can intelligently respond to meta questions while preserving murder mystery immersion

**Example Flow**:
```
User: "Who made this?" 
  → Character: [Brief meta response] 
  → Character: [Returns to 1947] 
  → User: "Where were you at 9:15?"
  → Character: [Full story immersion]
```

**Result**: Best of both worlds - users can learn about the hackathon AND enjoy the murder mystery! 🎯
