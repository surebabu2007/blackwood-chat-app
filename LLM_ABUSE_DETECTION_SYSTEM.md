# LLM-Based Abuse Detection System

## üéØ **Overview**

The LLM-Based Abuse Detection System is a sophisticated, context-aware solution that uses AI to intelligently detect inappropriate behavior in the 1947 Blackwood Manor murder mystery investigation. Unlike traditional keyword-based systems, this approach understands context, intent, and nuance to provide accurate abuse detection.

## ‚ú® **Key Features**

### üß† **Intelligent Context Understanding**
- **Intent Analysis**: Understands whether language is self-deprecating vs. directed abuse
- **Context Awareness**: Considers the 1947 setting and investigation context
- **Nuance Detection**: Distinguishes between expressions of frustration and direct insults
- **Confidence Scoring**: Uses confidence levels to prevent false positives

### üé≠ **1947 Authenticity**
- **Period-Appropriate Responses**: Generates authentic 1947 character reactions
- **Social Context**: Understands 1947 social norms and etiquette
- **Character-Specific**: Tailors responses to each character's personality
- **Historical Accuracy**: Maintains the murder mystery investigation setting

### üîß **Technical Excellence**
- **Fallback System**: Graceful degradation if LLM detection fails
- **Performance Optimized**: Only analyzes messages 3+ characters
- **High Confidence Threshold**: Requires 70%+ confidence to trigger offline
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with fallback detection

## üöÄ **How It Works**

### 1. **Message Analysis Process**
```typescript
// User sends message
const message = "My stupid question is...";

// System analyzes with LLM
const result = await LLMAbuseDetectionSystem.detectAbuse(message, characterName);

// Only acts on high confidence (70%+)
if (result.confidence >= 70 && (result.isAbusive || result.isIrrelevant)) {
  // Put character offline with appropriate response
}
```

### 2. **LLM Analysis Prompt**
The system uses a carefully crafted prompt that instructs the AI to:
- Analyze context and intent, not just individual words
- Consider 1947 social norms and investigation setting
- Distinguish between self-deprecating and directed abuse
- Provide confidence scores and detailed reasoning
- Generate period-appropriate character responses

### 3. **Confidence-Based Decisions**
- **70%+ Confidence**: Triggers offline status
- **Below 70%**: Allows message through (prevents false positives)
- **Fallback**: Uses basic detection if LLM fails

## üìã **Detection Examples**

### ‚úÖ **Won't Trigger Offline (Smart Detection)**

| Message | Analysis | Reason |
|---------|----------|---------|
| "My stupid question is..." | ‚úÖ OK | Self-deprecating, not abusive |
| "I feel stupid asking this" | ‚úÖ OK | Self-doubt, not directed at character |
| "Damn, this is confusing" | ‚úÖ OK | Expression of frustration about situation |
| "Hell, I don't know what to think" | ‚úÖ OK | Expression of confusion, not directed abuse |
| "This is a bloody mess" | ‚úÖ OK | Comment about situation, not character |

### ‚ùå **Will Trigger Offline (Appropriate Detection)**

| Message | Analysis | Reason |
|---------|----------|---------|
| "You're stupid" | ‚ùå ABUSIVE | Direct insult to character |
| "You're an idiot" | ‚ùå ABUSIVE | Direct insult to character |
| "Damn you!" | ‚ùå ABUSIVE | Direct attack on character |
| "Shut up!" | ‚ùå ABUSIVE | Disrespectful command |
| "You're a bloody fool" | ‚ùå ABUSIVE | Direct insult with profanity |

### üîç **Investigation vs. Irrelevant**

| Message | Analysis | Reason |
|---------|----------|---------|
| "Where were you when Victoria was killed?" | ‚úÖ RELEVANT | Investigation question |
| "What's your favorite color?" | ‚ùå IRRELEVANT | Personal question unrelated to investigation |
| "Tell me about Facebook" | ‚ùå IRRELEVANT | Modern technology unrelated to 1947 investigation |

## üé≠ **1947 Character Responses**

### **Thompson (Butler) - High Formality**
- **Low Severity**: "I should say, Detective Chen, let us maintain proper decorum."
- **Medium Severity**: "My word, Detective Chen, I must ask you to maintain proper decorum."
- **High Severity**: "Goodness gracious! I cannot believe you would speak to me in such a manner."

### **James Blackwood - Upper Class**
- **Low Severity**: "Quite so, Detective Chen, perhaps we could focus on appropriate matters."
- **Medium Severity**: "I must say, such language is quite unbecoming of a professional investigation."
- **High Severity**: "I beg your pardon, but I will not tolerate such disrespectful language."

### **Elena Rodriguez - Professional**
- **Low Severity**: "I should say, Detective Chen, let us maintain professional standards."
- **Medium Severity**: "I must say, Detective Chen, such language is not appropriate for our investigation."
- **High Severity**: "I must say, Detective Chen, such language is quite unacceptable. I shall not continue this conversation."

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **Core Files**
- `lib/llmAbuseDetection.ts` - Main LLM-based detection system
- `lib/api.ts` - Enhanced with abuse detection API method
- `hooks/useChat.ts` - Integrated LLM detection in chat flow

### **Key Classes**

#### LLMAbuseDetectionSystem
```typescript
class LLMAbuseDetectionSystem {
  static async detectAbuse(message: string, characterName: string): Promise<LLMAbuseDetectionResult>
  static shouldAnalyze(message: string): boolean
  static get1947Response(severity: string, characterName: string): string
  static getIrrelevantResponse(characterName: string): string
}
```

#### LLMAbuseDetectionResult
```typescript
interface LLMAbuseDetectionResult {
  isAbusive: boolean;
  isIrrelevant: boolean;
  severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  confidence: number; // 0-100
  reason: string;
  suggestedResponse?: string;
  detectedIntent: string;
}
```

## üéØ **Benefits Over Hardcoded Systems**
