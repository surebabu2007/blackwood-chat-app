## 📋 Timeline Events Implemented

Based on `script.rpy`, the following timeline events are now enforced:

1. **Victoria's Death** (9:27 PM) - All characters know about this
2. **Lily's Visit** (9:20-9:25 PM) - Only Lily and butler witnessed
3. **James's Visit** (9:05-9:15 PM) - Only James and butler witnessed  
4. **Dr. Elena's Visit** (8:55-9:00 PM) - Only Elena and butler witnessed
5. **Marcus's Visit** (8:40-8:50 PM) - Only Marcus and butler witnessed
6. **Wine Delivery** (8:35 PM) - Only butler witnessed
7. **Victoria Working** (8:30 PM) - Only butler witnessed

## 🎭 Character Constraints

### Mr. Thompson (Butler)
- **Availability**: Always available (0% progress)
- **Trust Required**: Low (10-30%)
- **Information Sharing**: Open and cooperative
- **Timeline Knowledge**: All events (witnessed most)

### James Blackwood (Brother)
- **Availability**: 25% progress onwards
- **Trust Required**: Medium (50-80%)
- **Information Sharing**: Guarded, becomes defensive
- **Timeline Knowledge**: Victoria's death, his visit only

### Marcus Reynolds (Business Partner)
- **Availability**: 25% progress onwards
- **Trust Required**: Medium (70-85%)
- **Information Sharing**: Secretive, manipulative
- **Timeline Knowledge**: Victoria's death, his visit only

### Dr. Elena Rodriguez (Doctor)
- **Availability**: 50% progress onwards
- **Trust Required**: High (75-90%)
- **Information Sharing**: Professional but guarded
- **Timeline Knowledge**: Victoria's death, her visit only

### Lily Chen (Niece)
- **Availability**: 50% progress onwards
- **Trust Required**: High (85-100%)
- **Information Sharing**: Open but emotional
- **Timeline Knowledge**: Victoria's death, her visit only

## 🔄 Investigation Phases

1. **Initial Arrival** (0-10%): Only butler available
2. **Crime Scene Investigation** (10-25%): Butler only, basic info
3. **Initial Interviews** (25-50%): Butler, James, Marcus available
4. **Deep Investigation** (50-75%): All characters available
5. **Final Confrontation** (75-100%): All characters, defensive behavior

## 🛡️ Response Validation

The system now validates all character responses against:
- **Timeline Constraints**: Characters can't reveal information they don't know
- **Trust Requirements**: Sensitive information requires appropriate trust levels
- **Forbidden Topics**: Characters can't discuss certain topics at specific phases
- **Knowledge Limits**: Characters are limited to their actual knowledge

## 🎮 User Experience Improvements

1. **Progressive Unlocking**: Characters become available as investigation progresses
2. **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators for locked/available characters
3. **Tooltips**: Explanations for why characters are locked
4. **Realistic Interactions**: Characters respond according to their actual knowledge
5. **Trust Building**: Players must build trust to get sensitive information

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Response Flow
1. User sends message
2. Timeline context is generated
3. Character response is generated with timeline constraints
4. Response is validated against timeline constraints
5. Forbidden content is filtered out
6. Valid response is displayed to user

### Character Availability Flow
1. Investigation progress is checked
2. Current phase is determined
3. Character constraints are applied
4. Available characters are filtered
5. UI is updated with availability status

## 📊 Benefits Achieved

1. **Consistency**: Characters respond according to their actual knowledge
2. **Immersion**: Realistic investigation progression
3. **Challenge**: Higher trust levels required for sensitive information
4. **Replayability**: Different character availability creates varied experiences
5. **Story Integrity**: Prevents characters from revealing information they shouldn't know
6. **Edge Case Prevention**: No more characters knowing things they shouldn't

## 🧪 Testing

- Created comprehensive test suite (`test-timeline-integration.js`)
- Timeline validation working correctly
- Character availability system functional
- Response filtering active
- UI components updated and working

## 📚 Documentation

- **Timeline Integration Guide**: Complete usage documentation
- **Implementation Summary**: This document
- **Code Comments**: Extensive inline documentation
- **Type Definitions**: Full TypeScript support

## ✅ Edge Cases Handled

1. **Character Knowledge**: Characters can't reveal information they don't know
2. **Timeline Violations**: Responses are filtered for timeline inconsistencies
3. **Trust Levels**: Sensitive information requires appropriate trust
4. **Phase Progression**: Characters become available at appropriate times
5. **Location Constraints**: Characters available only in appropriate locations
6. **Response Validation**: All responses validated before display

## 🚀 Ready for Production

The timeline and world context system is now fully integrated and ready for use. Characters will strictly adhere to the timeline and world context from `script.rpy`, providing a realistic and immersive investigation experience.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

The system is designed to be extensible for future enhancements:
- Dynamic trust requirements
- Location-specific responses
- Time-based availability
- Relationship dynamics
- Evidence-based unlocking
