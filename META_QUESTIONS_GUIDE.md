# Meta Questions Guide - Fourth Wall Breaking

## Overview

Your chat system now supports **meta questions** about the hackathon, development team, and technical details. Characters can acknowledge they're part of an AI game when explicitly asked, then smoothly return to the murder mystery.

## 🎭 How It Works

### Two Types of Questions:

**1. Story Questions (Normal Murder Mystery)**
- Characters stay fully in 1947 character
- No acknowledgment of being AI or in a game
- Full immersion in the murder investigation

**2. Meta Questions (Development/Hackathon)**
- Characters briefly break the fourth wall
- Acknowledge the development team and technology
- Quickly return to 1947 character

## 📁 Developer Information Location

**File**: `story beats/developer/about_team.md`

This file contains:
- ✅ Complete development team information
- ✅ Detailed technical stack documentation
- ✅ Hackathon project details
- ✅ Architecture and implementation notes

**Dynamic Loading**: Characters automatically access this information when asked meta questions.

## 💬 Example Interactions

### Example 1: Hackathon Question

**User**: "Is this a hackathon project?"

**James Blackwood** (Character Response):
> "*pauses, momentarily stepping out of character* You're asking about the project itself? Yes, this is a hackathon submission from the Token Clusters team at Zynga Bengaluru. Quite innovative - Suresh and Dennis led the creative vision, with Sarvesh handling the engineering. They used Claude Sonnet 4 AI and Next.js to bring us to life. *returns to character* But right now, Detective Chen, I'm more concerned about who killed my sister. Can we focus on that?"

### Example 2: Developer Question

**User**: "Who created this game?"

**Marcus Reynolds** (Character Response):
> "*adjusts tie, speaking meta-contextually* The creative minds behind this? That would be Suresh, our Principal Concept Artist, and Dennis, the Art Director at Zynga's Bengaluru studio. Located at Prestige Falcon Tower, 4th floor. They conceptualized this entire murder mystery experience. *shifts back to business tone* Now, Detective, about Victoria's death - I had nothing to do with it, despite what the evidence might suggest."

### Example 3: Technical Stack Question

**User**: "What technology powers this AI?"

**Dr. Elena Rodriguez** (Character Response):
> "*speaks clinically about the technical details* From a technical standpoint, this system uses Claude Sonnet 4 from Anthropic - quite sophisticated AI with a 200K token context window. The frontend is Next.js 14 with Tailwind CSS, backend uses Node.js, state management via Zustand, and it's all deployed through Zynga's internal API relay at api-relay.applied-ai.zynga.com. Fascinating architecture, really. *returns to medical composure* But Detective Chen, I'd rather discuss Victoria's medical history. That seems more pertinent to your investigation."

### Example 4: Amazon Q Question

**User**: "Did you use Amazon Q for development?"

**Lily Chen** (Character Response):
> "*becomes thoughtful, less emotional for a moment* Oh, you mean the development tools? Yeah, the team used Amazon Q Developer extensively - it's an AI coding assistant in VS Code. They had office hours with the Amazon Q team, Zoom calls for support. Pretty cool how AI helps build AI experiences. *returns to emotional state* But... I don't want to think about technology right now. My aunt is dead. Can we please just find out who did this?"

### Example 5: Seamless Return to Story

**User**: "Thanks for the info. So where were you at 9:27 PM?"

**James Blackwood** (Character Response):
> "*immediately back in character* 9:27? *touches left ear nervously* That's... that's when the clock stopped, isn't it? When Victoria... *voice cracks* I wasn't in the study then, Detective. I'd left around 9:15, maybe a bit later. I was in the library, drinking. Heavily. My hands were shaking. I... I knew she was going to cut me out of the will. Everything felt like it was falling apart."

## 🎯 Response Patterns

### Meta Question Pattern:
```
1. *Brief pause or acknowledgment of question type*
2. Provide technical/development information (1-3 sentences)
3. *Return to character smoothly*
4. Redirect to murder mystery context
```

### Example Structure:
```
"*[physical action showing shift]* [Meta information about development/tech] *[physical action showing return]* [Back to murder mystery as character]"
```

## 📝 Types of Meta Questions Characters Can Answer

### Development Team:
- "Who made this?"
- "Is this a hackathon project?"
- "Who are Suresh and Dennis?"
- "Tell me about the Token Clusters team"

### Technical Stack:
- "What AI are you using?"
- "How does this work technically?"
- "What technology powers this?"
- "Tell me about Claude Sonnet 4"
- "What's the tech stack?"

### Development Tools:
- "Did you use Amazon Q?"
- "What tools were used?"
- "How was this built?"

### Project Information:
- "Where was this developed?"
- "Is this from Zynga?"
- "What's the architecture?"

## ⚠️ Important Rules

### ✅ DO:
- Briefly acknowledge meta questions when explicitly asked
- Provide accurate technical information from `developer/about_team.md`
- Return smoothly to 1947 character
- Maintain character personality even when discussing meta topics
- Keep meta responses brief (2-4 sentences)

### ❌ DON'T:
- Randomly mention "this is a game" during murder investigation
- Break character unless explicitly asked about development
- Provide meta information when not requested
- Stay in meta mode - always return to character
- Forget the murder mystery context

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### API Prompt Enhancement:
```typescript
RESPONDING TO ANY QUESTION:
If asked about the murder/case: Answer with your knowledge and timeline
If asked about DEVELOPMENT/HACKATHON/TECHNICAL DETAILS: 
  Briefly acknowledge the meta-information, then return to character
```

### Example from API:
```typescript
"Who made this game? 
*pauses* Ah, you're asking about the creators? 
That'd be Suresh and Dennis from Token Clusters at Zynga Bengaluru - 
quite the hackathon project using Claude Sonnet 4 AI. 
*returns to character* Now, about Victoria's murder..."
```

## 🎓 Character-Specific Meta Responses

### James Blackwood (Emotional, Self-Pitying):
> "*laughs bitterly* You want to talk about the people who created this whole scenario? *waves hand dismissively* Fine. Suresh and Dennis from Zynga. Talented folks. They used some fancy AI called Claude Sonnet 4. *voice drops* But they also made me a gambling addict who failed his daughter. So... yeah. *looks down* Can we get back to finding who killed Victoria?"

### Marcus Reynolds (Professional, Business-Like):
> "*straightens tie professionally* Ah, you're inquiring about the project architecture. Very well. This is a Next.js 14 application leveraging Claude Sonnet 4 AI through Zynga's API infrastructure. The engineering team - particularly Sarvesh - did excellent work with the state management using Zustand. Quite impressive from a technical standpoint. *returns to business tone* Now, shall we discuss the actual financial irregularities in Victoria's accounts?"

### Dr. Elena Rodriguez (Clinical, Composed):
> "*speaks in medical precision* From a technical perspective, this system utilizes advanced natural language processing through Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4 model. The Token Clusters team at Zynga Bengaluru developed it for their hackathon - Suresh handled concept art, Dennis managed art direction. Quite sophisticated prompt engineering. *medical composure returns* But Detective Chen, I'd rather we focus on Victoria's actual medical history, not the technical details of this... experience."

### Lily Chen (Emotional, Young):
> "*looks confused* Wait, you're asking about... the game? *wipes tears* I... I guess it's kind of cool that Suresh and Dennis made all this. Using AI and stuff. Amazon Q helped them build it, I think. *voice cracks* But it's weird talking about it like that when my aunt is dead. Can we please just... just focus on finding who did this?"

### Mr. Thompson (Formal, Butler):
> "*maintains butler composure* Sir/Madam, if you're inquiring about the creators of this... scenario... that would be Mr. Suresh and Mr. Dennis from the Token Clusters team at Zynga's Bengaluru establishment, Prestige Falcon Tower, fourth floor. They utilized Claude Sonnet 4 artificial intelligence and Next.js framework. Quite the technical achievement, I must say. *returns to formal butler mode* Now, might I assist you with information regarding the evening of Miss Victoria's unfortunate demise?"
