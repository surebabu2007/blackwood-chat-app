# Memory System - Quick Explanation

## ✅ YES! Characters Have Memory

Your chat system **already remembers conversations**. I just made it even better!

---

## How Characters Remember You

### 1️⃣ **Previous Messages**
- Remembers last **15 messages** you discussed
- References earlier topics naturally
- Example: *"Like I said before..."*

### 2️⃣ **Secrets Already Told**
- Won't repeat the same information
- Builds on what they've shared
- Example: *"I already told you about the $50,000..."*

### 3️⃣ **Trust Building**
- Starts defensive (Trust: 20)
- Becomes more open as you talk (Trust: 60)
- Eventually vulnerable (Trust: 80)

### 4️⃣ **Gets Frustrated with Repetition** (NEW!)
- Example: *"Detective, weren't you listening? I already answered that!"*

## Real Example

**First Time Asked:**
```
You: "Do you gamble?"
James: "I... sometimes play cards."
```

**Second Time Asked:**
```
You: "Do you gamble?"
James: "I already told you - yes, I gamble. $50,000 in debt."
```

**Third Time Asked:**
```
You: "Do you gamble?"
James: "*frustrated* Detective Chen! We've been over this! 
The gambling, the fifty thousand, the loan sharks. 
Were you not paying attention?"
```
