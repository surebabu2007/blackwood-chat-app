# Character Offline System

## Overview

The Character Offline System is a sophisticated feature that makes character interactions more natural and realistic by temporarily putting characters offline when users ask inappropriate questions or use abusive language. This system enhances immersion by mimicking how real people would react to inappropriate behavior in 1947.

## üéØ Key Features

### 1. **Abuse Detection**
- Detects inappropriate language and profanity
- Identifies irrelevant questions not related to the investigation
- Uses 1947-appropriate sensitivity levels
- Categorizes severity levels (low, medium, high)

### 2. **Automatic Offline Status**
- Characters go offline for 40-60 seconds based on severity
- Visual indicators show offline status in real-time
- Characters become unresponsive during offline period
- Automatic return to online status after cooldown

### 3. **1947 Authentic Responses**
- Period-appropriate language and expressions
- Formal, respectful responses even when offended
- Character-specific reactions based on their personality
- Natural offline and return messages

### 4. **Visual Feedback**
- Red offline indicators on character cards
- Countdown timer showing time until return
- Disabled chat input when character is offline
- Tooltips explaining offline reasons

## üöÄ How It Works

### Detection Process

```typescript
// 1. User sends message
const message = "You're an idiot!";

// 2. System detects abuse
const detection = AbuseDetectionSystem.detectAbuse(message);
// Result: { isAbusive: true, severity: 'medium', reason: 'Inappropriate language detected' }

// 3. Character goes offline
CharacterStatusManager.setCharacterOffline(
  characterId,
  detection.reason,
  detection.suggestedResponse,
  45 // seconds
);

// 4. Visual feedback updates
// - Character card shows red offline indicator
// - Chat input becomes disabled
// - Countdown timer appears
```

### Offline Duration by Severity

| Severity | Duration | Example Triggers |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| **Low** | 40 seconds | Mild inappropriate language |
| **Medium** | 45 seconds | Moderate abuse or irrelevant questions |
| **High** | 60 seconds | Severe profanity or threats |

## üìã Detected Content Types

### Abusive Language (1947 Appropriate)
- **Mild**: "damn", "hell", "bloody", "confound"
- **Moderate**: "idiot", "moron", "stupid", "shut up"
- **Severe**: "bastard", "bitch", threats, personal attacks

### Irrelevant Questions
- **Modern Technology**: computers, internet, social media, phones
- **Modern Concepts**: COVID, climate change, modern politics
- **Personal Questions**: age, appearance, relationship status
- **Off-topic**: weather, jokes, entertainment, general chat

### Appropriate Investigation Topics
- Victoria's murder and investigation details
- Character relationships and alibis
- Timeline and location questions
- Evidence and clues discussion
- Family and business matters

## üé® Visual Indicators

### Character Cards
```typescript
// Online Status
<div className="w-3 h-3 bg-green-500 rounded-full">
  <Wifi className="w-3 h-3 text-green-400" />
  <span>Online</span>
</div>

// Offline Status
<div className="w-3 h-3 bg-red-500 rounded-full">
  <WifiOff className="w-3 h-3 text-red-400" />
  <span>Offline (45s)</span>
</div>
```

### Chat Input
- **Online**: Normal amber styling, enabled
- **Offline**: Red border, disabled, offline indicator
- **Countdown**: Shows remaining time until character returns

## üí¨ Character Responses

### Offline Messages (Examples)
- "I must say, Detective Chen, such language is quite unacceptable. I shall not continue this conversation."
- "Goodness gracious! I cannot believe you would speak to me in such a manner. This is quite shocking."
- "I should say, Detective Chen, that question is not relevant to our investigation into Victoria's death."

### Return Messages (Examples)
- "Thompson has returned, looking more composed and ready to continue our investigation."
- "James Blackwood rejoins the conversation, appearing to have regained their composure."
- "Elena Rodriguez is back and appears ready to continue with the investigation."
